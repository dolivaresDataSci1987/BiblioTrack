# BiblioTrack
BiblioTrack is a lightweight single-page app to manage personal libraries. Add, edit, and search books, track your reading, keep a wishlist, and export your data to JSON, CSV, or PDF. Works fully offline with localStorage or syncs to a chosen local folder via the File System Access API.
