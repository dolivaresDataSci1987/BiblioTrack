Created by **David Olivares**.

## How it works

BiblioTrack lets you manage your book collection in a simple and intuitive way, fully offline:

- **Library**: Add, edit, delete, and search books by title, author, editorial, category, subcategory, or location.  
- **Wishlist**: Keep track of books you want to buy or read later. Add prices, store links, and export to PDF.  
- **Reading Club**: Track books you are currently reading and mark them as completed.  
- **Cover images**: Optional â€“ activate remote loading to display book covers (privacy-first: disabled by default).  
- **Data Export**: Generate backups in JSON, CSV, or PDF format.  
- **Local Storage**: All your data is saved automatically in your browser.  
- **Local Folder Sync**: Optionally, connect a local folder (via File System Access API) to keep persistent JSON files for library, wishlist, and reading list.
